## Requirements

- You need to be logged into an OpenShift or Kubernetes environment
  with an appropriate level of access.

- You need an inventory file with a `mailman_servers` group (and you
  need ssh access with appropriate privileges to servers in that
  group).

- You need the [`moc.mailman` ansible collection](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-ansible-mailman).
